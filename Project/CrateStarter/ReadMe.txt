This html will display a page with the text CrateBoard. If the user clicks in the window, it will show an initial crateboard as a prompt in an input pop-up. When the popup is dismissed, we can click again and get another prompt.

This starter version shows appropriate code including a class (a constructor). But it always generates the same sized board, the same weights of the crates, no bob, and no target.

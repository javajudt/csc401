                <h2>Who</h2>
                <p>The competition is hosted by the THS Robotics Club in 
                    cooperation with Timbuktu High School.</p>
                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>This is a robot competition! We have three events in which 
                    a team can participate: Sprint, Battle, and Maze.</p>
                <h2>Where</h2>
                <p>The event will take place at Timbuktu High School. 
                    Follow the signs.</p>
                <h2>When</h2>
                <p>We're planning the competition for February 30, 2034. 
                    Subject to change due to weather, of course.</p>
                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>For fun! Why not?! Also, to introduce robotics to high 
                    school students. As our world becomes more and more 
                    automated, it is increasingly important to teach upcoming 
                    generations about robotics and computing.</p>
